### Core Hours
Weekdays: 9-6PM
Weekends: Up to you
If you want to work on something out of core hours, check in with group.

### Workflow
* Use Trello, your trello card should essential match your feature branch
* Feature branch everything
* Time-box your features, don't rabbit hole
* Use resources...teachers, students, team.
* Once you're finished, make a pull request but do not merge so that others can review.
#### Trello Flow
  * *Todo:* New to-dos/features go in ToDo. Try to keep it concise and put detail within the card
  * *In-Progress:* When it moves to in-progress, assign members to it so we know who's working on it
  * *For Review:* When finished, moved to In-Review and make a pull request(if applicable) so that teammates can review
  * *Pretty Done:* Once it's reviewed, moved to Pretty Done (nothings really ever done...)
