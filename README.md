### Core Hours
**Weekdays:** 9-6PM <br>
**Weekends:** Up to you<br>
If you want to work on something out of core hours, check in with group.

### Workflow
* You should totally pair, but it's contextual
* We will pseudocode before we begin most coding tasks
* Use Trello, your trello card should essential match your feature branch
* Feature branch everything
* Time-box your features, don't rabbit hole
* Use resources...teachers, students, team.
* Once you're finished, make a pull request but do not merge so that others can review.

#### Trello Flow
* **Todo:** New to-dos/features go in ToDo. Try to keep it concise and put detail within the card
* **In-Progress:** When it moves to in-progress, assign members to it so we know who's working on it
* **For Review:** When finished, moved to In-Review and make a pull request(if applicable) so that teammates can review
* **Pretty Done:** Once it's reviewed, moved to Pretty Done (nothings really ever done...)

### Check-Ins
(Always up for change)
* **Morning** (9am)
  * Aha Moments
  * What we're going/want to work on
* **Afternoon** (2pm)
